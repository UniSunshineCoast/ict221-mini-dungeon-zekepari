## Game Overview

**MiniDungeon** is a 2D grid-based dungeon crawler game built in Java featuring both JavaFX GUI and console interfaces. Players navigate through procedurally generated 10×10 dungeon levels, collecting items, avoiding traps, fighting mutants (including specialized ranged enemies), and progressing through levels to win the game.

### Core Game Loop
1. **Exploration**: Navigate a 10×10 grid using arrow keys, mouse clicks, or console commands
2. **Resource Management**: Monitor HP (health), score, and step count
3. **Item Collection**: Gather gold for points and health potions for survival
4. **Combat**: Encounter melee and ranged mutant enemies with different behaviors
5. **Progression**: Find ladders to advance through 2 dungeon levels
6. **Victory/Defeat**: Win by completing level 2, lose by running out of HP or steps
7. **Action Logging**: Track all game events through integrated logging system

## How to Play

### Starting the Game
- **GUI Mode**: Launch with `./gradlew run` or run the `RunGame` class
  - Difficulty selection dialog appears on startup and when creating new games
- **Console Mode**: Run `GameEngine.main()` for text-based interface with commands
  - Pass difficulty as argument: `java -cp build/classes/java/main dungeon.engine.GameEngine <1-5>`
  - Or use interactive prompt for difficulty selection
- Player starts at position (0,0) - the entry point
- Initial stats: 10 HP, 0 Score, 0 Steps, Level 1

### Movement Controls
- **GUI Mode**:
  - **Keyboard**: Arrow keys (↑↓←→) or WASD keys
  - **Mouse**: Click directional arrow buttons in the UI
- **Console Mode**: 
  - **Commands**: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` for movement
  - **Special**: `save`, `load`, `quit` for game management
- Each movement costs 1 step (maximum 100 steps before game over)

### Cell Types & Interactions

| Cell Type | Visual | Effect | Persistence |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Empty** | Gray square | Safe passage | Permanent |
| **Wall** | Dark barrier | Blocks movement | Permanent |
| **Entry** | Starting position | Safe spawn point | Permanent |
| **Gold** | Yellow coin | +2 Score | Consumed |
| **Health Potion** | Red bottle | +4 HP (max 10) | Consumed |
| **Trap** | Spikes | -2 HP | Permanent |
| **Melee Mutant** | Enemy sprite | -2 HP, +2 Score | Defeated |
| **Ranged Mutant** | Archer enemy | -2 HP (50% hit rate, 2-tile range), +2 Score | Defeated |
| **Ladder** | Staircase | Next level | One-time use |

### Win/Loss Conditions
- **Victory**: Reach and use the ladder on Level 2

---

## Core Systems

### 1. Position & Coordinate System
**Class**: `dungeon.engine.Position`
- **Immutable** coordinate representation (row, col)
- **Bounds**: 0-9 for both dimensions (10×10 grid)
- **Operations**: `plus(Direction)` for movement calculation
- **Validation**: Automatic bounds checking, returns null for invalid positions

```java
Position current = new Position(5, 5);
Position newPos = current.plus(Direction.UP); // (4, 5)
```

### 2. Direction System
**Enum**: `dungeon.engine.Direction`
- **Values**: UP(-1,0), DOWN(1,0), LEFT(0,-1), RIGHT(0,1)
- **Input Mapping**: Converts JavaFX KeyCode to Direction
- **Support**: Arrow keys + WASD keys for accessibility

### 3. Cell System Architecture
**Interface**: `dungeon.engine.cells.Cell`
- **Core Methods**: 
  - `onEnter(Player, GameEngine)`: Triggered when player enters
  - `spritePath()`: Returns image path for rendering
- **Inheritance**: `AbstractItemCell` base class for consumable items

**Cell Implementations**:
- **`EmptyCell`**: Basic traversable space
- **`WallCell`**: Impassable barrier  
- **`EntryCell`**: Player spawn point
- **`GoldCell`**: +2 score, disappears after collection
- **`HealthPotionCell`**: +4 HP (capped at 10), disappears
- **`TrapCell`**: -2 HP, remains dangerous
- **`LadderCell`**: Level progression trigger
- **`MeleeMutantCell`**: Enemy encounter (-2 HP, +2 score, disappears)
- **`RangedMutantCell`**: Ranged enemy with sight-line mechanics

### 4. Player System
**Class**: `dungeon.engine.Player`
- **State Management**: HP (0-10), Score, Steps, Level, Position
- **HP System**: Automatic clamping to 0-10 range
- **Movement**: Position updates with step counting
- **Persistence**: Serializable for save/load functionality

**Key Methods**:
- `takeDamage(int)`: Reduces HP with bounds checking
- `heal(int)`: Increases HP with maximum cap
- `incrementSteps()`: Tracks movement for loss condition
- `modifyHp(int)`: General HP modification with clamping

### 5. Game Engine
**Class**: `dungeon.engine.GameEngine`
- **Central Controller**: Orchestrates all game systems
- **Game Loop**: Handles movement, cell interactions, win/loss detection
- **Level Management**: Generates new maps, tracks progression
- **State Checking**: Monitors HP, steps, and level completion
- **Action Logging**: Integrated logging system with pluggable loggers
- **Console Interface**: Full command-line gameplay support

**Core Workflow**:
1. `move(Direction)` → validates movement
2. `movePlayer()` → updates position, triggers cell effects
3. `checkGameOverConditions()` → evaluates win/loss states
4. `advanceToNextLevel()` → handles level progression
5. `processRangedMutantTurns()` → handles ranged enemy actions
6. `logAction(String)` → records events to current logger

### 6. Action Logging System
**Interface**: `dungeon.engine.ActionLogger`
- **Abstraction**: Common interface for different logging outputs
- **Implementations**: Console and GUI-specific loggers
- **Thread Safety**: GUI logger uses Platform.runLater for JavaFX threading

**Logger Implementations**:
- **`ConsoleActionLogger`**: Direct System.out.println for console mode
- **`GuiActionLogger`**: JavaFX TextArea with auto-scrolling and thread safety

  - 1 Entry (0,0), 1 Ladder (random position)
  - 5 Gold pieces, 5 Trap cells, 2 Health Potions
  - 3 Melee Mutants + difficulty-based Ranged Mutants
  - Remaining cells filled as Empty or Wall

### Combat System
- **Melee Combat**: Automatic when entering mutant cells
- **Ranged Combat**: Mutants shoot at player within 2 tiles in cardinal directions
- **Damage**: All mutants deal 2 HP damage
- **Hit Mechanics**: Ranged mutants have 50% hit chance, blocked by walls
- **Rewards**: Defeating mutants grants 2 score points
- **Resolution**: Mutants disappear after being defeated

### Ranged Mutant Mechanics
- **Sight Range**: 2 tiles in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)
- **Line of Sight**: Blocked by walls and other obstacles
- **Hit Probability**: 50% chance to hit when player is in range
- **Turn Processing**: Act during dedicated ranged mutant phase
- **Stepping Interaction**: Player can step on ranged mutants like melee mutants

### Level Progression
- **Level 1 → 2**: Find and enter the ladder
- **Level 2 → Victory**: Find and enter the second ladder
- **Map Regeneration**: New procedural layout for each level
- **Player Persistence**: HP, score, and steps carry over

### Resource Management
- **HP**: Starts at 10, consumed by traps and mutants, restored by potions
- **Steps**: Limited to 100 total across all levels
- **Score**: Accumulated through gold collection and mutant defeats
